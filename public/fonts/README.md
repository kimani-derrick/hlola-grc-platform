# Geomanist Font Files

This directory should contain the Geomanist font files as specified in the brand guidelines.

## Required Font Files:

### Geomanist Regular (400)
- `Geomanist-Regular.woff2`
- `Geomanist-Regular.woff`

### Geomanist Medium (500) 
- `Geomanist-Medium.woff2`
- `Geomanist-Medium.woff`

### Geomanist Bold (700)
- `Geomanist-Bold.woff2`
- `Geomanist-Bold.woff`

## Font Usage (Brand Guidelines):

- **Geomanist Bold**: For impact and emphasis (headings, important text)
- **Geomanist Regular**: For clarity and body text
- **Geomanist Medium**: For buttons and UI elements (actions stand out without shouting)

## Implementation:

The font family is already configured in the CSS with proper fallbacks:
```css
font-family: 'Geomanist', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
```

## Next Steps:

1. Obtain the Geomanist font files from your brand resources
2. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames listed above
3. The website will automatically use Geomanist when the files are available
4. Fallback fonts will be used until the Geomanist files are added

## Brand Characteristics:

- Clean, modern, and quietly confident
- Simple, strong, and easy to read across all formats
- Used everywhere possible to maintain brand consistency
